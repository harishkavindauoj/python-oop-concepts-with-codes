## 📘 What's Inside

This notebook covers the **4 main pillars of OOP**:

1. **Encapsulation**
   - Hiding internal state using private attributes
   - Using getters, setters, and Python properties

2. **Inheritance**
   - Creating child classes from parent classes
   - Method overriding and using `super()`

3. **Polymorphism**
   - Common interfaces, different implementations
   - How to use polymorphism with different classes

4. **Abstraction**
   - Hiding complexity using abstract classes and methods
   - Focusing on *what* an object does rather than *how*
